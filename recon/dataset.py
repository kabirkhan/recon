class Dataset:
    """A Dataset is a around a List of examples.
    Datasets are responsible for tracking all Operations done on them.
    This ensures data lineage and easy reporting of how changes in the 
    data based on various Operations effects overall quality.
    
    Dataset holds state (let's call it self.operations for now)
    self.operations is a list of every function run on the Dataset since it's
    initial creation. If loading from disk, track everything that happens in loading
    phase in operations as well by simply initializing self.operations in constructors
    
    Each operation should has the following attributes:
        operation hash
        name: function/callable name ideally, could be added with a decorator
        status: (not_started|completed)
        transformations: List[Transformation]
            commit hash
            timestamp(s) - start and end both? end is probably enough
            examples deleted
            examples added
            examples corrected
            annotations deleted
            annotations added
            annotations corrected

            for annotations deleted/added/corrected, include mapping from old Example hash to new Example hash
            that can be decoded for display later

    All operations are serializable in the to_disk and from_disk methods.

    So if I have 10 possible transformations.

    I can run 1..5, save to disk train a model and check results. 
    Then I can load that model from disk with all previous operations already tracked
    in self.operations. Then I can run 6..10, save to disk and train model.
    Now I have git-like "commits" for the data used in each model.
